🚀 Building a Keras-based Hate Speech Detection Model! 🤖

I recently worked on a project to build a Hate Speech Detection model using Keras and TensorFlow. The goal was to classify text messages (e.g., tweets or social media posts) into two categories:

0: Non-Hate Speech
1: Hate Speech
Here’s a quick overview of what I accomplished:

🔍 Dataset & Preprocessing
I used a custom dataset of text messages labeled as hate or non-hate speech. The preprocessing pipeline involved:

Tokenizing the text data: Converting text into sequences of integers (words).
Padding the sequences: Ensuring that all sequences had the same length for input to the neural network.
🧠 Model Architecture
The model was designed to process natural language input and output a binary classification (hate or non-hate):

Embedding Layer: Encodes words into dense vectors.
Bidirectional LSTM Layer: Captures sequential relationships in the text, processing it both from left-to-right and right-to-left.
Dense Layers: Extracts features and makes predictions based on the sequence of words.
Dropout Layer: Regularizes the model to prevent overfitting.
⚙️ Training & Optimization
The model was trained with:

Adam Optimizer: For efficient optimization of the model.
Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: Since it’s a binary classification task.
Class Weights: To handle imbalanced datasets by assigning higher importance to the minority class.
Early Stopping: To prevent overfitting by halting training when the validation loss stops improving.
📊 Model Evaluation
I evaluated the model using the test dataset and achieved a high level of accuracy, demonstrating the model’s ability to detect hate speech in real-world scenarios.

💡 Use Case
This model can be used to detect harmful or offensive content in text, which can be very useful for platforms, content moderators, and social media platforms aiming to prevent the spread of hate speech online.
